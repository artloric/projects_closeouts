# Circular Economy Training for South African Manufacturing

## ACEN–UFS–merSETA Programme

A national circular economy capacity-building project, managed using a hybrid PMI / Agile approach, with a full deliverable-based risk governance system designed and implemented end-to-end.

**Role:** Project Manager (Hybrid PMI / Scrum)

**Domain:** Circular Economy · Skills Development

**Focus:** Risk Management · Stakeholder Alignment

---

## Overview

The ACEN–UFS–merSETA programme aimed to build circular economy capabilities within the South African manufacturing ecosystem. The project delivered 15 integrated outputs across desktop research, webinar design, training framework development, African and South African case studies, and a comprehensive close-out report with recommendations for future CE skills interventions.

As Project Manager, the work was structured into six coherent workstreams:

- Desktop research on CE actors, programmes, and value chains.
- Webinar design and delivery to introduce CE concepts and opportunities.
- Training frameworks and materials for engineers, manufacturers, and SMME mentors.
- African and South African CE case studies with critical success factors.
- Four live training sessions reaching engineers and SMME mentors.
- Final close-out reporting, lessons learned, and future recommendations.

This required balancing academic expectations, sector authority requirements, and practical constraints in a policy-sensitive, data-limited environment.

## Risk governance

### Hybrid PMI / Agile Risk Management

I designed a risk management system that combines PMI-style qualitative analysis with Agile delivery practices. Each risk is linked to specific deliverables and workstreams and scored using a 5×5 Likelihood × Impact matrix.

Key elements:

- Deliverable-based risk register with 15 core risks mapped to C3–C16.
- Qualitative scoring (Low / Medium / High) + numerical severity bands.
- 5×5 heatmap for stakeholder-friendly visualisation of exposure.
- Risk stories integrated into the Jira backlog for sprint-level mitigation.
- Early-warning indicators defined for each high-impact risk.

Risks such as data gaps, policy shifts, low training attendance, and restricted case study access were prioritised and tracked iteratively, with mitigation work packaged into sprints and reviewed with key stakeholders.

## Key Artefacts & Downloads

The following artefacts are included in this repository to demonstrate end-to-end risk governance on a complex, multi-stakeholder project. In an interview or portfolio review, I typically walk through how each item fits into the overall governance approach.

- Risk Register (Markdown) — Human-readable register linking risks to deliverables, owners, and early-warning indicators. [Open risk-register.md](risk-register.md)
- Risk Register (Excel Workbook) — Excel file with three sheets: Risk Register, Risk Summary (pivot), and Heatmap (5×5 matrix). [Download risk-register.xlsx](risk-register.xlsx)
- Risk Register (CSV) — Lightweight CSV for import into other tools, BI dashboards, or data analysis notebooks. [Download risk-register.csv](risk-register.csv)
- Risk Matrix Heatmap (PNG) — 5×5 Likelihood × Impact heatmap using a classic green–yellow–red palette for presentations. [View heatmap.png](heatmap.png)
- Mermaid Heatmap Snippet — Mermaid.js definition for embedding a risk heatmap directly into GitHub or documentation sites. [Open mermaid-heatmap.md](mermaid-heatmap.md)
- Jira Risk Backlog (CSV) — Importable CSV mapping risks into Jira as “Risk” issues for Agile tracking. [Download risk-register-jira-import.csv](risk-register-jira-import.csv)

## How I Use This in My Practice

This microsite is part of my project management portfolio. It demonstrates how I apply hybrid PMI and Agile methods to real-world, multi-stakeholder programmes in sustainability, research, and training contexts.

In conversation with hiring managers or clients, I use this case study to discuss:

- How risk governance supports delivery in policy-sensitive environments.
- How I balance academic, regulatory, and operational constraints.
- How I embed risk thinking into Agile cadences (sprints, reviews, retrospectives).
- How tools like Jira, Excel, and visual heatmaps can work together.

You can explore the artefacts linked above or connect with me directly to talk through the design decisions and implementation details behind this system.
