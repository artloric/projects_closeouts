# ACEN–UFS merSETA Project Risk Register

| Risk ID | Deliverable | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Severity | Risk Type | Mitigation | Owner | Early Warning |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| A1 | C3.1 Desktop Research | Data gaps in CE structures and role-players | High | High | 16 | Critical | Technical / Knowledge | Triangulate with interviews, CSIR/DFFE/DSI sources, and stakeholder validation. | Research Lead | Missing or unverifiable CE actor data; repeated dead links. |
| A2 | C3.2 Opportunities Mapping | Findings misaligned with merSETA priorities and Sector Skills Plan. | Medium | High | 12 | High | Strategic | Iterative validation with UFS/ACEN; alignment reviews against merSETA SSP and chambers. | Project Manager | Feedback requesting significant restructuring or reframing of opportunities. |
| A3 | C3.3 Training Requirements | Complex mapping of CE interventions to skills may delay delivery. | Medium | Medium | 9 | Medium | Schedule / Scope | Use a modular mapping (CE interventions → value chains → skills) and Bloom’s taxonomy templates. | Curriculum Lead | Backlog items repeatedly rolled into later sprints for mapping work. |
| B1 | C4.1 Webinars | Subject Matter Experts unavailable for timely reviews and co-development. | Medium | Medium | 9 | Medium | Stakeholder / Resource | Asynchronous review (recorded walk-throughs); early booking of SME time; backup reviewers. | Project Manager | Missed or repeatedly rescheduled content review sessions. |
| B2 | C4.1 Webinars | Policy and regulatory updates may rapidly outdate webinar content. | High | Medium | 12 | High | External / Quality | Include a ‘check latest policy’ slide; maintain a simple policy change log and update pack. | Curriculum Lead | New circular economy policy or regulation announcements relevant to training focus. |
| C1 | C5.1/C5.2 Frameworks | Training frameworks may not fully align with NQF and SAQA requirements. | Medium | High | 12 | High | Quality / Compliance | Early SAQA/NQF crosswalk; design outcomes using Bloom’s taxonomy; peer review by academic partner. | Curriculum Lead | Reviewer comments flag unclear outcomes or misaligned levels. |
| C2 | Training Materials | Outdated manufacturing/CE data in training materials reduces credibility. | High | High | 16 | Critical | Technical / Reputation | Base materials on latest CSIR/DTIC/Stats SA reports; design slides to be easily updateable by year. | Curriculum Lead | Participants or partners query figures or policy references as out-of-date. |
| D1 | C11–C15 Training Delivery | Low attendance due to operational pressures on E&Ms and SMME mentors. | Medium | High | 12 | High | Operational | Hybrid delivery; flexible scheduling; CPD or certificate incentives; targeted communications. | Project Manager | Registrations below threshold; high drop-off between registration and attendance. |
| D2 | C11–C15 Training Delivery | Technology failures during online/hybrid training sessions. | Medium | Medium | 9 | Medium | Technical / Operational | Tech rehearsal; redundant platforms (Teams/Zoom); local recording of content; backup facilitator. | Tech Lead | Failed tech tests; unstable connectivity reported by facilitator or host institution. |
| E1 | C8–C10 Case Studies | Restricted access to case study data due to confidentiality or commercial sensitivity. | Medium | High | 12 | High | Stakeholder / Legal | Use NDAs; anonymise cases; offer aggregated reporting; prioritise organisations with prior CE engagement. | Project Manager | Delays in signing agreements or refusal to share operational/financial details. |
| E2 | C9 Case Study Execution | Travel and fieldwork delays impact case study timelines. | Medium | Medium | 9 | Medium | Schedule / External | Hybrid data collection (remote interviews); buffer time in schedule; prioritise digitally accessible sites. | Project Manager | Repeated travel postponements or budget constraints affecting planned field visits. |
| F1 | C16 Close-Out | Incomplete evidence base (attendance lists, feedback, version history) for final close-out report. | Medium | High | 12 | High | Quality / Governance | Create a Deliverable Evidence Tracker; weekly repo checks; assign evidence ownership per workstream. | Project Manager | Missing attachments or untracked deliverable iterations close to reporting deadlines. |
| F2 | C16 Close-Out | Stakeholder misalignment on lessons, findings, and recommendations. | Low | High | 8 | Medium | Strategic / Stakeholder | Pre-close-out alignment workshop; circulate draft findings; explicitly document points of divergence. | Project Manager | Conflicting feedback from ACEN, UFS, and merSETA on interim reports. |
